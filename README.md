## Overall Description of The Visualization and its Purpose

The dataset in this visualization is obtained from kaggle and is titled as "Global Coffee Health Dataset". 
This visualization is meant to help people gain overall insights into the relationship between coffee consumption and a number of factors such as 
the amount of sleep they receive and their exact caffeine intake in milligrams. I hope that the visualization is fun and 
insightful and the animations are interesting enough for the viewers.
